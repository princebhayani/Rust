# Rust

- learning rust from the basics.
- It covers concepts like memory management, ownership, borrowing, structures, data types, enums, and much more.

## 01 Preface
### Phrase #1
- In Rust, if you program compiles, it probably works.

### Phrase #2
- You can't segfault if you don't have null.

### Phrase #3
- Rust doesn't hide complexity from developers it offers them the right tools to manage all the complexity.

## 02 Why rust? Isn’t Node.js enough?
### Type safety
### Systems language
It is intended to be used (but not restricted to) to do lower level things
1. Building a Compiler
2. Building a browser
3. Working closer to the OS/kernel

### Generally faster
- Rust has a separate compilation step (similar to C++) that spits out an optimized binary and does a lot of static analysis at compile time. 
- JS does JIT compilation.

### Concurrency
- Rust has built-in support for concurrent programming allowing multiple threads to perform tasks simultaneously without risking data races.
- Javascript is single threaded generally (there are some projects that tried making it multi threaded but rarely used).

### Memory safe
- Rust has a concept of owners, borrowing and lifetimes that make it extremely memory safe.

- Rust projects can be used to do a lot of things
    1. Create Backend for a Full stack app
    2. Create CLIs (command line interfaces)
    3. Create browsers
    4. Great Code Editors

- For running rust locally, you should be able to run cargo in your terminal.
> [!NOTE]
> Cargo is similar to npm. It’s a package manager for rust.
